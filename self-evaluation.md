# How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

- I feel fairly confident.  It makes sense and seems very logical and straightforward.

# Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

- I want to do more research and practice with array methods.  In my research, I kept coming across the description of methods that will do whatever they're intended, and then "return the value that was popped/pushed/shifted/etc".  That wasn't what I was experiencing in my practice, I just got the array back with the added or removed value.  I will find some videos of someone doing it and see if theirs looks the same as mine or if I'm missing something.

# What questions do you have about Arrays?

- Mostly I want to discover more methods and things you can do with arrays, and how they are applied practically in actual code.
